This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Command provided by LaiOffer
```bash
yarn create react-app around-web
yarn add antd@3
yarn add react-router-dom@4
yarn add react-grid-gallery

# react-router-dom is a library
to realize "sigle page application" (SPA)
1.只有一個完整頁面
2. 點擊頁面中的連結，比如去page2，頁面不會被刷新，也就是不會向後端口發送請求
3. 頁面變化只是局部變化
4. 那麼不同頁面中的數據如何獲取？通過Ajax實現，拿到數據並不刷新數據
SPA的產生讓server成為一個提供數據的API，數據展現在前端完成

* 那麼什麼是ROUTER?
路由的本質就是一對KEY-VAL Pair，key = PATH, val = Resource
resource對前端來說是一個components，對後端是一個函數

所以現在的問題是，1.如何找key，2.如何對應到val
```
